Gif-A-Tweet:

This app allows users to enter a twitter handle. The app will then choose a random tweet from the users timeline. Using regular expressions and a stop words list, all non-important words are removed, and two keywords from the remaining list of words remain. Those words are then used as search terms in an API request to Giphy.com.

Planned extensions of this app to improve functionality:
- Update Stop Words list to include other common words that often come up as stop words
- Create a list of "popular words" that produce great GIFS that will be given extra weight (or are always chosen) as keywords
